# Speedometer – How Fast Am I?

## What is this?

Summarized, "Speedometer – How Fast Am I?" is a small app that shows your current speed in different units of speed (mph, km/h, mi/s and kn). Additionally, your current position on the globe is displayed by using the geographic coordinate system.

It is a really small app which serves this one purpose: Showing your current speed (and your current position) without disturbing banner ads and free of charge.

## Why did you do this?

I started iOS development in summer of 2017.

This app was intended as a small "playground" project to go through the whole lifecyle of an app: build, release, run, repeat. App Store Connect was new to me and I just wanted to gain experiences with an example project.

Then I reached a point when I thought that I should release this app, just for fun. There were not that much plain simple (and cost-free) speedometer apps available, so now there is one.

## Where do I find the app?

Download the app for free [on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1361655713?pt=118900544&ct=repository-readme&mt=8). It is localized in English and German, the latter is my native language.
