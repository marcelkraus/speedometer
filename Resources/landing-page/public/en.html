          <p>This is a plain and simple app I wrote as a ‚Äúplayground‚Äù project to go through the whole lifecyle of an app: develop, release, refine ‚Äì and repeat this process over and over.</strong></p>
          <p>At some point during the development process, I thought that I should just release this app ‚Äì for free. There were not that much plain simple (and cost-free) speedometer apps available at that time.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, ‚ÄúSpeedometer ‚Äì How Fast Am I?‚Äù shows your current speed in different units (for example mph, km/h and m/s). Additionally, your current position on the globe is displayed using the geographic coordinate system.</p>
